Description: SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix
 Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems,
 providing support for cross-platform file and printer sharing with
 Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix systems.  Samba can also function
 as an NT4-style domain controller, and can integrate with both NT4 domains
 and Active Directory realms as a member server.
 .
 This package provides the components necessary to use Samba as a
 stand-alone file and print server.  For use in an NT4 domain or Active
 Directory realm, you will also need the winbind package.
 .
 This package is not required for connecting to existing SMB/CIFS servers
 (see smbclient) or for mounting remote filesystems (see smbfs).

 providing support for cross-platform file and printer sharing with
 Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix systems.
 .
 This package contains files and programs needed by Samba when used as
 either a client or a server.

Description: Samba testing utilities
 Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems,
 providing support for cross-platform file and printer sharing with
 Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix systems.  Samba can also function
 as an NT4-style domain controller, and can integrate with both NT4 domains
 and Active Directory realms as a member server.
 .
 This package contains command-line tools such as smbtorture for
 performance-testing CIFS servers or clients.

Description: command-line SMB/CIFS clients for Unix
 Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems,
 providing support for cross-platform file and printer sharing with
 Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix systems.
 .
 This package contains command-line utilities for accessing Microsoft
 Windows and Samba servers, including smbclient, smbtar, and smbspool.
 Utilities for mounting shares locally are found in the package smbfs.

Description: Samba Web Administration Tool
 Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems,
 providing support for cross-platform file and printer sharing with
 Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix systems.
 .
 This package gives a Samba server an administrative interface accessible
 via a web browser.
 .
 SWAT is no longer actively maintained, and its default configuration is
 not secure for use over an untrusted network. You should also avoid
 using it if you have a carefully crafted Samba configuration file; SWAT
 will rewrite smb.conf, rearranging the entries and deleting all comments
 as well as include= and copy= options.

Suggests: samba
Description: pluggable authentication module for Samba
 This is a module for PAM that enables a system administrator to migrate
 user passwords from the Unix password database to the SMB password
 database as used by Samba, and to subsequently keep the two databases in
 sync.  Unlike other solutions, it does this without needing users to log
 in to Samba using cleartext passwords, or requiring them to change their
 existing passwords.

Package: libsmbclient

Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: shared library for communication with SMB/CIFS servers
 This package provides a shared library that enables client applications
 to talk to Microsoft Windows and Samba servers using the SMB/CIFS
 protocol.

 and Active Directory realms as a member server.
 .
 This package provides winbindd, a daemon which can integrate the
 user/group lookup and authentication mechanisms from a Windows domain
 with their equivalents on the Samba side. Thus for example users who
 have Active Directory accounts can automatically be given working
 /etc/password logins and vice versa, once /etc/nsswitch.conf and the
 winbind module for PAM are configured appropriately.
