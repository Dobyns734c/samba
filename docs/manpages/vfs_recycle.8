&#8962;SH "NAME"
vfs_recycle - Samba VFS recycle bin
&#8962;SH "SYNOPSIS"
&#8962;HP 1
vfs objects = recycle
&#8962;SH "DESCRIPTION"
&#8962;PP
This VFS module is part of the
&#9619;fBsamba&#9619;fR(7)
suite.
&#8962;PP
The
vfs_recycle
intercepts file deletion requests and moves the affected files to a temporary repository rather than deleting them immediately. This gives the same effect as the Recycle Bin on Windows computers.
&#8962;PP
The Recycle Bin will not appear in Windows Explorer views of the network file system (share) nor on any mapped drive. Instead, a directory called .recycle will be automatically created when the first file is deleted and recycle:repository is not configured. If recycle:repository is configured, the name of the created directory depends on recycle:repository. Users can recover files from the recycle bin. If the recycle:keeptree option has been specified, deleted files will be found in a path identical with that from which the file was deleted.
&#8962;PP
This module is stackable.
&#8962;SH "OPTIONS"
&#8962;PP
recycle:repository = PATH
&#8962;RS 4
Path of the directory where deleted files should be moved.
&#8962;sp
If this option is not set, the default path .recycle is used.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
recycle:directory_mode = MODE
&#8962;RS 4
Set MODE to the octal mode the recycle repository should be created with. The recycle repository will be created when first file is deleted. If recycle:subdir_mode is not set, MODE also applies to subdirectories.
&#8962;sp
If this option is not set, the default mode 0700 is used.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
recycle:subdir_mode = MODE
&#8962;RS 4
Set MODE to the octal mode with which sub directories of the recycle repository should be created.
&#8962;sp
If this option is not set, subdirectories will be created with the mode from recycle:directory_mode.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
recycle:keeptree = BOOL
&#8962;RS 4
Specifies whether the directory structure should be preserved or whether the files in a directory that is being deleted should be kept separately in the repository.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
recycle:versions = BOOL
&#8962;RS 4
If this option is True, two files with the same name that are deleted will both be kept in the repository. Newer deleted versions of a file will be called "Copy #x of filename".
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
recycle:touch = BOOL
&#8962;RS 4
Specifies whether a file's access date should be updated when the file is moved to the repository.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
recycle:touch_mtime = BOOL
&#8962;RS 4
Specifies whether a file's last modified date should be updated when the file is moved to the repository.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
recycle:minsize = BYTES
&#8962;RS 4
Files that are smaller than the number of bytes specified by this parameter will not be put into the repository.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
recycle:maxsize = BYTES
&#8962;RS 4
Files that are larger than the number of bytes specified by this parameter will not be put into the repository.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
recycle:exclude = LIST
&#8962;RS 4
List of files that should not be put into the repository when deleted, but deleted in the normal way. Wildcards such as * and ? are supported.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
recycle:exclude_dir = LIST
&#8962;RS 4
List of directories whose files should not be put into the repository when deleted, but deleted in the normal way. Wildcards such as * and ? are supported.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
recycle:noversions = LIST
&#8962;RS 4
Specifies a list of paths (wildcards such as * and ? are supported) for which no versioning should be used. Only useful when recycle:versions is enabled.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;SH "EXAMPLES"
&#8962;PP
Log operations on all shares using the LOCAL1 facility and NOTICE priority:

.nf

        &#9619;fI[global]&#9619;fR
	vfs objects = recycle
	recycle:facility = LOCAL1
	recycle:priority = NOTICE
