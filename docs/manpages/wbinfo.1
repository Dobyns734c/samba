&#8962;SH "DESCRIPTION"
&#8962;PP
This tool is part of the
&#9619;fBsamba&#9619;fR(7)
suite.
&#8962;PP
The
wbinfo
program queries and returns information created and used by the
&#9619;fBwinbindd&#9619;fR(8)
daemon.
&#8962;PP
The
&#9619;fBwinbindd&#9619;fR(8)
daemon must be configured and running for the
wbinfo
program to be able to return information.
&#8962;SH "OPTIONS"
&#8962;PP
