.SH "NAME"
idmap_ldap - Samba's idmap_ldap Backend for Winbind
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The idmap_ldap plugin provides a means for Winbind to store and retrieve SID/uid/gid mapping tables in an LDAP directory service\. The module implements both the "idmap" and "idmap alloc" APIs\.
.SH "IDMAP OPTIONS"
.PP
ldap_base_dn = DN
.RS 4
Defines the directory base suffix to use when searching for SID/uid/gid mapping entries\. If not defined, idmap_ldap will default to using the "ldap idmap suffix" option from smb\.conf\.
.RE
.PP
ldap_user_dn = DN
.RS 4
Defines the user DN to be used for authentication\. If absent an anonymous bind will be performed\.
.RE
.PP
ldap_url = ldap://server/
.RS 4
Specifies the LDAP server to use when searching for existing SID/uid/gid map entries\. If not defined, idmap_ldap will assume that ldap://localhost/ should be used\.
.RE
.PP
range = low \- high
.RS 4
Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the backend is authoritative\. Note that the range commonly matches the allocation range due to the fact that the same backend will store and retrieve SID/uid/gid mapping entries\. If the parameter is absent, Winbind fail over to use the "idmap uid" and "idmap gid" options from smb\.conf\.
.RE
.SH "IDMAP ALLOC OPTIONS"
.PP
ldap_base_dn = DN
.RS 4
Defines the directory base suffix under which new SID/uid/gid mapping entries should be stored\. If not defined, idmap_ldap will default to using the "ldap idmap suffix" option from smb\.conf\.
.RE
.PP
ldap_user_dn = DN
.RS 4
Defines the user DN to be used for authentication\. If absent an anonymous bind will be performed\.
.RE
.PP
ldap_url = ldap://server/
.RS 4
Specifies the LDAP server to which modify/add/delete requests should be sent\. If not defined, idmap_ldap will assume that ldap://localhost/ should be used\.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The follow sets of a LDAP configuration which uses two LDAP directories, one for storing the ID mappings and one for retrieving new IDs\.

.nf
	[global]
	idmap backend = ldap:ldap://localhost/
	idmap uid = 1000000\-1999999
	idmap gid = 1000000\-1999999

	idmap alloc backend = ldap
	idmap alloc config : ldap_url	= ldap://id\-master/
	idmap alloc config : ldap_base_dn = ou=idmap,dc=example,dc=com

.SH "NOTE"
.PP
In order to use authentication against ldap servers you may need to provide a DN and a password\. To avoid exposing the password in plain text in the configuration file we store it into a security store\. The "net idmap " command is used to store a secret for the DN specified in a specific idmap domain\.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\.
