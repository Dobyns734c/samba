&#8962;SH "NAME"
ldbedit - Edit LDB databases using your preferred editor
&#8962;SH "SYNOPSIS"
&#8962;HP 1
ldbedit [-?] [--usage] [-s&#9600;base|one|sub] [-b&#9600;basedn] [-a] [-e&#9600;editor] [-H&#9600;LDB-URL] [expression] [attributes...]
&#8962;SH "DESCRIPTION"
&#8962;PP
ldbedit is a utility that allows you to edit LDB entries (in tdb files, sqlite files or LDAP servers) using your preferred editor. ldbedit generates an LDIF file based on your query, allows you to edit the LDIF, and then merges that LDIF back into the LDB backend.
&#8962;SH "OPTIONS"
&#8962;PP
-?, --help
&#8962;RS 4
Show list of available options, and a phrase describing what that option does.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
--usage
&#8962;RS 4
Show list of available options. This is similar to the help option, however it does not provide any description, and is hence shorter.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-H <ldb-url>
&#8962;RS 4
LDB URL to connect to. For a tdb database, this will be of the form tdb://&#9619;fIfilename&#9619;fR. For a LDAP connection over unix domain sockets, this will be of the form ldapi://&#9619;fIsocket&#9619;fR. For a (potentially remote) LDAP connection over TCP, this will be of the form ldap://&#9619;fIhostname&#9619;fR. For an SQLite database, this will be of the form sqlite://&#9619;fIfilename&#9619;fR.

&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-a, -all
&#8962;RS 4
Edit all records. This allows you to apply the same change to a number of records at once. You probably want to combine this with an expression of the form "objectclass=*".
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-e editor, --editor editor
&#8962;RS 4

&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
