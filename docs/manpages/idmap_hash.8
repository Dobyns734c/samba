The idmap_hash plugin implements a hashing algorithm used map SIDs for domain users and groups to a 31\-bit uid and gid\. This plugin also implements the nss_info API and can be used to support a local name mapping files if enabled via the "winbind normlaize names" and "winbind nss info" parameters in smb\.conf\.
