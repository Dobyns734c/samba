&#8962;SH "NAME"
idmap_rid - Samba's idmap_rid Backend for Winbind
&#8962;SH "DESCRIPTION"
&#8962;PP
The idmap_rid backend provides a way to use an algorithmic mapping scheme to map UIDs/GIDs and SIDs. No database is required in this case as the mapping is deterministic.
&#8962;SH "IDMAP OPTIONS"
&#8962;PP
range = low - high
&#8962;RS 4
Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter. If algorithmically determined UID or GID fall outside the range, they are ignored and the corresponding map is discarded. It is intended as a way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps between local and remotely defined IDs.

&#8962;PP
base_rid = INTEGER
&#8962;RS 4
Defines the base integer used to build SIDs out of an UID or a GID, and to rebase the UID or GID to be obtained from a SID. User RIDs by default start at 1000 (512 hexadecimal), this means a good value for base_rid can be 1000 as the resulting ID is calculated this way: ID = RID - BASE_RID + LOW RANGE ID.

This example shows how to configure 2 domains with idmap_rid

.nf

	[global]
	    idmap domains = MAIN TRUSTED1

	    idmap config MAIN:backend      = rid
	    idmap config MAIN:base_rid     = 0
	    idmap config MAIN:range        = 10000 - 49999

	    idmap config TRUSTED1:backend  = rid
	    idmap config TRUSTED1:base_rid = 1000
	    idmap config TRUSTED1:range    = 50000 - 99999

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
