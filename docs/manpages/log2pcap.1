&#8962;SH "NAME"
log2pcap - Extract network traces from Samba log files
&#8962;SH "SYNOPSIS"
&#8962;HP 1
log2pcap [-h] [-q] [logfile] [pcap_file]
&#8962;SH "DESCRIPTION"
&#8962;PP
This tool is part of the
&#9619;fBsamba&#9619;fR(7)
suite.
&#8962;PP
log2pcap
reads in a samba log file and generates a pcap file (readable by most sniffers, such as ethereal or tcpdump) based on the packet dumps in the log file.
&#8962;PP
The log file must have a
&#9619;fIlog level&#9619;fR
of at least
&#9619;fB5&#9619;fR
to get the SMB header/parameters right,
&#9619;fB10&#9619;fR
to get the first 512 data bytes of the packet and
&#9619;fB50&#9619;fR
to get the whole packet.
&#8962;SH "OPTIONS"
&#8962;PP
-h
&#8962;RS 4
If this parameter is specified the output file will be a hex dump, in a format that is readable by the
text2pcap
utility.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-q
&#8962;RS 4
Be quiet. No warning messages about missing or incomplete data will be given.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
logfile
&#8962;RS 4

&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
pcap_file
&#8962;RS 4

&#8962;SH "EXAMPLES"
&#8962;PP
Extract all network traffic from all samba log files:
&#8962;PP

&#8962;sp

.nf

			$ log2pcap < /var/log/* > trace.pcap
	
.fi

&#8962;PP
Convert to pcap using text2pcap:
&#8962;PP

&#8962;sp

.nf

	$ log2pcap -h samba.log | text2pcap -T 139,139 - trace.pcap
	
.fi

&#8962;SH "VERSION"
&#8962;PP
This man page is correct for version 3.0 of the Samba suite.
&#8962;SH "BUGS"
&#8962;PP
Only SMB data is extracted from the samba logs, no LDAP, NetBIOS lookup or other data.
&#8962;PP
The generated TCP and IP headers don't contain a valid checksum.
