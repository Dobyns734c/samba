&#8962;PP

&#9619;fI$TAPE&#9619;fR
variable specifies the default tape device to write to. May be overridden with the -t option.
&#8962;SH "BUGS"
&#8962;PP
The
smbtar
script has different options from ordinary tar and from smbclient's tar command.
&#8962;SH "CAVEATS"
&#8962;PP
Sites that are more careful about security may not like the way the script handles PC passwords. Backup and restore work on entire shares; should work on file lists. smbtar works best with GNU tar and may not work well with other versions.
&#8962;SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
&#8962;PP
See the
\fBDIAGNOSTICS\fR
section for the
&#9619;fBsmbclient&#9619;fR(1)

&#8962;SH "AUTHOR"
&#8962;PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
&#8962;PP
Ricky Poulten
wrote the tar extension and this man page. The
smbtar
script was heavily rewritten and improved by
Martin Kraemer. Many thanks to everyone who suggested extensions, improvements, bug fixes, etc. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
