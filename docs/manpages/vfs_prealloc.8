&#8962;SH "NAME"
vfs_prealloc - preallocate matching files to a predetermined size
&#8962;SH "SYNOPSIS"
&#8962;HP 1
vfs objects = prealloc
&#8962;SH "DESCRIPTION"
&#8962;PP
This VFS module is part of the
&#9619;fBsamba&#9619;fR(7)
suite.
&#8962;PP
The
vfs_prealloc
VFS module preallocates files to a specified size each time a new file is created. This is useful in environments where files are of a predetermined size will be written to a disk subsystem where extending file allocations is expensive.
&#8962;PP
This module is stackable.
&#8962;SH "OPTIONS"
&#8962;PP
prealloc:EXT = BYTES
&#8962;RS 4
Preallocate all files with the extension EXT to the size specified by BYTES.
&#8962;sp
The following suffixes may be applied to BYTES:
\(bu
K
- BYTES is a number of kilobytes
.TP
\(bu
M
- BYTES is a number of megabytes
.TP
\(bu
G
- BYTES is a number of gigabytes

&#8962;SH "EXAMPLES"
&#8962;PP
A process writes TIFF files to a Samba share, and the is known these files will almost always be around 4 megabytes (4194304 bytes):

.nf

        &#9619;fI[frames]&#9619;fR
	path = /data/frames
	vfs objects = prealloc
	prealloc:tiff = 4M

.fi
&#8962;SH "CAVEATS"
&#8962;PP
vfs_prealloc
is not supported on all platforms and filesystems. Currently only XFS filesystems on Linux and IRIX are supported.
&#8962;SH "VERSION"
&#8962;PP
This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of the Samba suite.
&#8962;SH "AUTHOR"
