&#8962;SH "DESCRIPTION"
&#8962;PP
This tool is part of the
&#9619;fBsamba&#9619;fR(7)
suite.
&#8962;PP
smbclient
is a client that can 'talk' to an SMB/CIFS server. It offers an interface similar to that of the ftp program (see
&#9619;fBftp&#9619;fR(1)). Operations include things like getting files from the server to the local machine, putting files from the local machine to the server, retrieving directory information from the server and so on.
&#8962;SH "OPTIONS"
&#8962;PP
servicename
&#8962;RS 4
servicename is the name of the service you want to use on the server. A service name takes the form
&#9619;fI//server/service&#9619;fR
where
&#9619;fIserver &#9619;fR
is the NetBIOS name of the SMB/CIFS server offering the desired service and
&#9619;fIservice&#9619;fR
is the name of the service offered. Thus to connect to the service "printer" on the SMB/CIFS server "smbserver", you would use the servicename
&#9619;fI//smbserver/printer &#9619;fR
&#8962;sp
Note that the server name required is NOT necessarily the IP (DNS) host name of the server ! The name required is a NetBIOS server name, which may or may not be the same as the IP hostname of the machine running the server.
&#8962;sp
The server name is looked up according to either the
&#9619;fI-R&#9619;fR
parameter to
smbclient
or using the name resolve order parameter in the
&#9619;fBsmb.conf&#9619;fR(5)
file, allowing an administrator to change the order and methods by which server names are looked up.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
password
&#8962;RS 4
The password required to access the specified service on the specified server. If this parameter is supplied, the
&#9619;fI-N&#9619;fR
option (suppress password prompt) is assumed.
&#8962;sp
There is no default password. If no password is supplied on the command line (either by using this parameter or adding a password to the
&#9619;fI-U&#9619;fR
option (see below)) and the
&#9619;fI-N&#9619;fR
option is not specified, the client will prompt for a password, even if the desired service does not require one. (If no password is required, simply press ENTER to provide a null password.)
&#8962;sp
Note: Some servers (including OS/2 and Windows for Workgroups) insist on an uppercase password. Lowercase or mixed case passwords may be rejected by these servers.
&#8962;sp
Be cautious about including passwords in scripts.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-R <name resolve order>
&#8962;RS 4
This option is used by the programs in the Samba suite to determine what naming services and in what order to resolve host names to IP addresses. The option takes a space-separated string of different name resolution options.
&#8962;sp
The options are :"lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast". They cause names to be resolved as follows:
\(bu
&#9619;fBlmhosts&#9619;fR: Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file. If the line in lmhosts has no name type attached to the NetBIOS name (see the
&#9619;fBlmhosts&#9619;fR(5)
for details) then any name type matches for lookup.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fBhost&#9619;fR: Do a standard host name to IP address resolution, using the system
&#9619;fI/etc/hosts &#9619;fR, NIS, or DNS lookups. This method of name resolution is operating system dependent, for instance on IRIX or Solaris this may be controlled by the
&#9619;fI/etc/nsswitch.conf&#9619;fR
file). Note that this method is only used if the NetBIOS name type being queried is the 0x20 (server) name type, otherwise it is ignored.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fBwins&#9619;fR: Query a name with the IP address listed in the
&#9619;fIwins server&#9619;fR
parameter. If no WINS server has been specified this method will be ignored.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fBbcast&#9619;fR: Do a broadcast on each of the known local interfaces listed in the
&#9619;fIinterfaces&#9619;fR
parameter. This is the least reliable of the name resolution methods as it depends on the target host being on a locally connected subnet.
&#8962;IP "" 4
If this parameter is not set then the name resolve order defined in the
&#9619;fBsmb.conf&#9619;fR(5)
file parameter (name resolve order) will be used.
&#8962;sp
The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast and without this parameter or any entry in the
&#9619;fIname resolve order &#9619;fR
parameter of the
&#9619;fBsmb.conf&#9619;fR(5)
file the name resolution methods will be attempted in this order.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-M NetBIOS name
&#8962;RS 4
This options allows you to send messages, using the "WinPopup" protocol, to another computer. Once a connection is established you then type your message, pressing ^D (control-D) to end.
&#8962;sp
If the receiving computer is running WinPopup the user will receive the message and probably a beep. If they are not running WinPopup the message will be lost, and no error message will occur.
&#8962;sp
The message is also automatically truncated if the message is over 1600 bytes, as this is the limit of the protocol.
&#8962;sp
One useful trick is to pipe the message through
smbclient. For example: smbclient -M FRED < mymessage.txt will send the message in the file
&#9619;fImymessage.txt&#9619;fR
to the machine FRED.
&#8962;sp
You may also find the
&#9619;fI-U&#9619;fR
and
&#9619;fI-I&#9619;fR
options useful, as they allow you to control the FROM and TO parts of the message.
&#8962;sp
See the
&#9619;fImessage command&#9619;fR
parameter in the
&#9619;fBsmb.conf&#9619;fR(5)
for a description of how to handle incoming WinPopup messages in Samba.
&#8962;sp
\fBNote\fR: Copy WinPopup into the startup group on your WfWg PCs if you want them to always be able to receive messages.

&#8962;PP
-p port
&#8962;RS 4
This number is the TCP port number that will be used when making connections to the server. The standard (well-known) TCP port number for an SMB/CIFS server is 139, which is the default.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-P
&#8962;RS 4
Make queries to the external server using the machine account of the local server.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-h|--help
&#8962;RS 4
Print a summary of command line options.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-I IP-address
&#8962;RS 4
&#9619;fIIP address&#9619;fR
is the address of the server to connect to. It should be specified in standard "a.b.c.d" notation.
&#8962;sp
Normally the client would attempt to locate a named SMB/CIFS server by looking it up via the NetBIOS name resolution mechanism described above in the
&#9619;fIname resolve order&#9619;fR
parameter above. Using this parameter will force the client to assume that the server is on the machine with the specified IP address and the NetBIOS name component of the resource being connected to will be ignored.
&#8962;sp
There is no default for this parameter. If not supplied, it will be determined automatically by the client as described above.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-E
&#8962;RS 4
This parameter causes the client to write messages to the standard error stream (stderr) rather than to the standard output stream.
&#8962;sp
By default, the client writes messages to standard output - typically the user's tty.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-L
&#8962;RS 4
This option allows you to look at what services are available on a server. You use it as
smbclient -L host
and a list should appear. The
&#9619;fI-I &#9619;fR
option may be useful if your NetBIOS names don't match your TCP/IP DNS host names or if you are trying to reach a host on another network.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-t terminal code
&#8962;RS 4
This option tells
smbclient
how to interpret filenames coming from the remote server. Usually Asian language multibyte UNIX implementations use different character sets than SMB/CIFS servers (\fBEUC\fR
instead of
\fB SJIS\fR
for example). Setting this parameter will let
smbclient
convert between the UNIX filenames and the SMB filenames correctly. This option has not been seriously tested and may have some problems.
&#8962;sp
The terminal codes include CWsjis, CWeuc, CWjis7, CWjis8, CWjunet, CWhex, CWcap. This is not a complete list, check the Samba source code for the complete list.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-b buffersize
&#8962;RS 4
This option changes the transmit/send buffer size when getting or putting a file from/to the server. The default is 65520 bytes. Setting this value smaller (to 1200 bytes) has been observed to speed up file transfers to and from a Win9x server.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-e
&#8962;RS 4
This command line parameter requires the remote server support the UNIX extensions. Request that the connection be encrypted. This is new for Samba 3.2 and will only work with Samba 3.2 or above servers. Negotiates SMB encryption using GSSAPI. Uses the given credentials for the encryption negotiaion (either kerberos or NTLMv1/v2 if given domain/username/password triple. Fails the connection if encryption cannot be negotiated.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-d|--debuglevel=level
&#8962;RS 4
&#9619;fIlevel&#9619;fR
is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 1.
&#8962;sp
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out.
&#8962;sp
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.
&#8962;sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the

parameter in the
&#9619;fIsmb.conf&#9619;fR
file.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-V
&#8962;RS 4
Prints the program version number.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-s <configuration file>
&#8962;RS 4
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See
&#9619;fIsmb.conf&#9619;fR
for more information. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-l|--log-basename=logdirectory
&#8962;RS 4
Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension
&#9619;fB".progname"&#9619;fR
will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-N
&#8962;RS 4
If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt from the client to the user. This is useful when accessing a service that does not require a password.
&#8962;sp
Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter is specified, the client will request a password.
&#8962;sp
If a password is specified on the command line and this option is also defined the password on the command line will be silently ingnored and no password will be used.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-k
&#8962;RS 4
Try to authenticate with kerberos. Only useful in an Active Directory environment.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-A|--authentication-file=filename
&#8962;RS 4
This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the username and password used in the connection. The format of the file is
&#8962;sp

&#8962;sp

.nf

username = <value>
password = <value>
domain   = <value>

.fi

&#8962;sp
Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-U|--user=username[%password]
&#8962;RS 4
Sets the SMB username or username and password.
&#8962;sp
If %password is not specified, the user will be prompted. The client will first check the
&#9619;fBUSER&#9619;fR
environment variable, then the
&#9619;fBLOGNAME&#9619;fR
variable and if either exists, the string is uppercased. If these environmental variables are not found, the username
&#9619;fBGUEST&#9619;fR
is used.
&#8962;sp
A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the plaintext of the username and password. This option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the credentials on the command line or via environment variables. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users. See the
&#9619;fI-A&#9619;fR
for more details.
&#8962;sp
Be cautious about including passwords in scripts. Also, on many systems the command line of a running process may be seen via the
ps
command. To be safe always allow
rpcclient
to prompt for a password and type it in directly.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-n <primary NetBIOS name>
&#8962;RS 4
This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself. This is identical to setting the

parameter in the
&#9619;fIsmb.conf&#9619;fR
file. However, a command line setting will take precedence over settings in
&#9619;fIsmb.conf&#9619;fR.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-i <scope>
&#8962;RS 4
This specifies a NetBIOS scope that
nmblookup
will use to communicate with when generating NetBIOS names. For details on the use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS scopes are
\fBvery\fR
rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you communicate with.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-W|--workgroup=domain
&#8962;RS 4
Set the SMB domain of the username. This overrides the default domain which is the domain defined in smb.conf. If the domain specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the client to log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the Domain SAM).
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-O socket options
&#8962;RS 4
TCP socket options to set on the client socket. See the socket options parameter in the
&#9619;fIsmb.conf&#9619;fR
manual page for the list of valid options.
&#8962;RE
&#8962;PP
-T tar options
&#8962;RS 4
smbclient may be used to create
tar(1)
compatible backups of all the files on an SMB/CIFS share. The secondary tar flags that can be given to this option are :
\(bu
&#9619;fIc&#9619;fR
- Create a tar file on UNIX. Must be followed by the name of a tar file, tape device or "-" for standard output. If using standard output you must turn the log level to its lowest value -d0 to avoid corrupting your tar file. This flag is mutually exclusive with the
&#9619;fIx&#9619;fR
flag.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fIx&#9619;fR
- Extract (restore) a local tar file back to a share. Unless the -D option is given, the tar files will be restored from the top level of the share. Must be followed by the name of the tar file, device or "-" for standard input. Mutually exclusive with the
&#9619;fIc&#9619;fR
flag. Restored files have their creation times (mtime) set to the date saved in the tar file. Directories currently do not get their creation dates restored properly.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fII&#9619;fR
- Include files and directories. Is the default behavior when filenames are specified above. Causes files to be included in an extract or create (and therefore everything else to be excluded). See example below. Filename globbing works in one of two ways. See
&#9619;fIr&#9619;fR
below.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fIX&#9619;fR
- Exclude files and directories. Causes files to be excluded from an extract or create. See example below. Filename globbing works in one of two ways now. See
&#9619;fIr&#9619;fR
below.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fIF&#9619;fR
- File containing a list of files and directories. The
&#9619;fIF&#9619;fR
causes the name following the tarfile to create to be read as a filename that contains a list of files and directories to be included in an extract or create (and therefore everything else to be excluded). See example below. Filename globbing works in one of two ways. See
&#9619;fIr&#9619;fR
below.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fIb&#9619;fR
- Blocksize. Must be followed by a valid (greater than zero) blocksize. Causes tar file to be written out in blocksize*TBLOCK (usually 512 byte) blocks.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fIg&#9619;fR
- Incremental. Only back up files that have the archive bit set. Useful only with the
&#9619;fIc&#9619;fR
flag.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fIq&#9619;fR
- Quiet. Keeps tar from printing diagnostics as it works. This is the same as tarmode quiet.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fIr&#9619;fR
- Regular expression include or exclude. Uses regular expression matching for excluding or excluding files if compiled with HAVE_REGEX_H. However this mode can be very slow. If not compiled with HAVE_REGEX_H, does a limited wildcard match on '*' and '?'.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fIN&#9619;fR
- Newer than. Must be followed by the name of a file whose date is compared against files found on the share during a create. Only files newer than the file specified are backed up to the tar file. Useful only with the
&#9619;fIc&#9619;fR
flag.
.TP
\(bu
&#9619;fIa&#9619;fR
- Set archive bit. Causes the archive bit to be reset when a file is backed up. Useful with the

-c command string
&#8962;RS 4
command string is a semicolon-separated list of commands to be executed instead of prompting from stdin.
&#9619;fI -N&#9619;fR

&#8962;SH "OPERATIONS"
&#8962;PP
Once the client is running, the user is presented with a prompt :
&#8962;PP
smb:\>
&#8962;PP
The backslash ("\\") indicates the current working directory on the server, and will change if the current working directory is changed.
&#8962;PP
The prompt indicates that the client is ready and waiting to carry out a user command. Each command is a single word, optionally followed by parameters specific to that command. Command and parameters are space-delimited unless these notes specifically state otherwise. All commands are case-insensitive. Parameters to commands may or may not be case sensitive, depending on the command.
&#8962;PP
You can specify file names which have spaces in them by quoting the name with double quotes, for example "a long file name".
&#8962;PP
Parameters shown in square brackets (e.g., "[parameter]") are optional. If not given, the command will use suitable defaults. Parameters shown in angle brackets (e.g., "<parameter>") are required.
&#8962;PP
Note that all commands operating on the server are actually performed by issuing a request to the server. Thus the behavior may vary from server to server, depending on how the server was implemented.

iosize <bytes>
&#8962;RS 4
When sending or receiving files, smbclient uses an internal memory buffer by default of size 64512 bytes. This command allows this size to be set to any range between 16384 (0x4000) bytes and 16776960 (0xFFFF00) bytes. Larger sizes may mean more efficient data transfer as smbclient will try and use the most efficient read and write calls for the connected server.

mask <mask>
&#8962;RS 4
This command allows the user to set up a mask which will be used during recursive operation of the mget and mput commands.
&#8962;sp
The masks specified to the mget and mput commands act as filters for directories rather than files when recursion is toggled ON.
&#8962;sp
The mask specified with the mask command is necessary to filter files within those directories. For example, if the mask specified in an mget command is "source*" and the mask specified with the mask command is "*.c" and recursion is toggled ON, the mget command will retrieve all files matching "*.c" in all directories below and including all directories matching "source*" in the current working directory.
&#8962;sp
Note that the value for mask defaults to blank (equivalent to "*") and remains so until the mask command is used to change it. It retains the most recently specified value indefinitely. To avoid unexpected results it would be wise to change the value of mask back to "*" after using the mget or mput commands.

&#8962;PP
Some servers are fussy about the case of supplied usernames, passwords, share names (AKA service names) and machine names. If you fail to connect try giving all parameters in uppercase.
&#8962;PP
It is often necessary to use the -n option when connecting to some types of servers. For example OS/2 LanManager insists on a valid NetBIOS name being used, so you need to supply a valid name that would be known to the server.

smbclient supports long file names where the server supports the LANMAN2 protocol or above.
&#8962;SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
&#8962;PP
The variable
&#9619;fBUSER&#9619;fR

&#8962;SH "INSTALLATION"
&#8962;PP
The location of the client program is a matter for individual system administrators. The following are thus suggestions only.
&#8962;PP
It is recommended that the smbclient software be installed in the
&#9619;fI/usr/local/samba/bin/&#9619;fR
or
&#9619;fI /usr/samba/bin/&#9619;fR
directory, this directory readable by all, writeable only by root. The client program itself should be executable by all. The client should
\fBNOT\fR
be setuid or setgid!
&#8962;PP
The client log files should be put in a directory readable and writeable only by the user.
&#8962;PP
To test the client, you will need to know the name of a running SMB/CIFS server. It is possible to run
&#9619;fBsmbd&#9619;fR(8)
as an ordinary user - running that server as a daemon on a user-accessible port (typically any port number over 1024) would provide a suitable test server.
&#8962;SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
&#8962;PP
Most diagnostics issued by the client are logged in a specified log file. The log file name is specified at compile time, but may be overridden on the command line.
&#8962;PP
The number and nature of diagnostics available depends on the debug level used by the client. If you have problems, set the debug level to 3 and peruse the log files.
&#8962;SH "VERSION"
&#8962;PP
This man page is correct for version 3.2 of the Samba suite.
&#8962;SH "AUTHOR"
&#8962;PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
&#8962;PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
