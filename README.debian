samba for DEBIAN
----------------

This package was built by me (Eloy Paris <peloy@debian.org>) based on work
from Bruce Perens <Bruce@Pixar.com>, Andrew Howell <andrew@it.com.au>,
Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org> and Michael Meskes <meskes@topsystem.de>,
all previous maintainers of the packages samba and sambades (now merged 
together - see below).

Password encryption is now supported in the standard samba package
(>= 1.9.18alpha12-1). This has been possible because Samba 1.9.18
and later does not depend on the DES encryption libraries. This makes
package sambades (part of the non-us section) obsolete.

Also, there are no more export restrictions with this version of Samba.

As of Samba 2.0.6-1, the Debian version of Samba is compiled with
Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) support. PAM support was 
discontinued during the libc5 -> libc6 migration process and I never
brought it back until 2.0.6-1. I don't use PAM myself so let me know
if you find any problems.

Since Samba 2.0.5a-3, the smbfs utilities included in the smbfs package
can now handle kernels > 2.0.x so there is no need to have two smbfs
packages.

As of Samba 2.0.5a-5, the Samba sources produce the following binary packages:

samba: A LanManager like file and printer server for Unix.
samba-common: Samba common files used by both the server and the client.
smbclient: A LanManager like simple client for Unix.
swat: Samba Web Administration Tool
samba-doc: Samba documentation.
smbfs: Mount and umount commands for the smbfs (works with 2.0.x and
	above kernels).

Please note that the package smbwrapper (a shared library that provides
SMB client services that  existed between Samba 2.0.0-1 and Samba-2.0.5a-4
does not exist any more. The reason is that starting with Samba 2.0.6-1, that
code does not even compile, and the upstream author (Andrew Tridgell)
recommended to disable the compilation of smbwrapper until some issues
with glibc2.1 get cleared out (the problem is with glibc, not with Samba
itself).

Support for NT Domains
----------------------

Samba 2.0 includes preliminary support for NT domains. A Samba server
can now be part of a Windows NT domain whose Primary Domain Controller
is a Windows NT server. This feature is supposed to be stable although I
haven't tried it myself. Read the documentation in the samba-doc package
for help on how to do this (hint: "security = domain" in the smb.conf
file).

Samba 2.0 has also experimental support for Primary Domain
Controller. This means that a Samba server can act now as a PDC. There
are no special flags needed to compile Samba with NT domain PDC
support. Please read the NTDOM PDC FAQ at www.samba.org (Documentation
section).

Please note that NT domain PDC support is far from complete and is still 
experimental. Furthermore, the NT PDC code in Samba 2.0 is old already
because a lot has changed since the release of Samba 2.0 and new development
has continued in the CVS tree. Look for the Debian packages of the CVS
snapshots in project/experimental. These are quite old because I have been
very busy with school to create frequent snapshots of the CVS tree.

Your comments are welcome.
