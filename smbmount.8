.TH SMBMOUNT 8 11-Nov-1999
.SH NAME
smbmount \- mount an SMB filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
Please check the man pages smbmount-2.2.x(8) and smbmount-2.0.x(8) for
specific details (syntax depends on whether you are running a 2.0.x or
a 2.2.x kernel).
.SH DESCRIPTION
The are two versions of the
.B smbmount
command. One is called
.B smbmount-2.2.x
and the other one is called
.B smbmount-2.0.x.
Two versions are required because of internal changes
inside the Linux kernel that prevent the use of a single binary for
different kernel versions.

/usr/bin/smbmount is actually a wrapper script that determines the
version of the kernel currently running and calls the appropiate binary
(smbmount-2.0.x or smbmount-2.2.x).

The wrapper script /usr/bin/smbmount just passes directly all the arguments 
it receives to the appropiate binary, so you still need to check the 
correct syntax in the corresponding man page.
