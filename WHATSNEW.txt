                               Mar 04, 2008
                   =================================

This is the second preview release of Samba 3.2.0.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Please be aware that Samba is now distributed under the version 3
of the new GNU General Public License.  You may refer to the COPYING
file that accompanies these release notes for further licensing details.

Major enhancements in Samba 3.2.0 include:

  File Serving:
  o Use of IDL generated parsing layer for several DCE/RPC
    interfaces.
  o Removal of the 1024 byte limit on pathnames and 256 byte limit on
    filename components to honor the MAX_PATH setting from the host OS.
  o Introduction of a registry based configuration system.
  o Improved CIFS Unix Extensions support.
  o Experimental support for file serving clusters.
  o Support for IPv6 in the server, and client tools and libraries.
  o Support for storing alternate data streams in xattrs.
  o Encrypted SMB transport in client tools and libraries, and server.
  o Support for Vista clients authenticating via Kerberos.

  Winbind and Active Directory Integration:
  o Full support for Windows 2003 cross-forest, transitive trusts
    and one-way domain trusts.
  o Support for userPrincipalName logons via pam_winbind and NSS
    lookups.
  o Expansion of nested domain groups via NSS calls.
  o Support for Active Directory LDAP Signing policy.
  o New LGPL Winbind client library (libwbclient.so).

  Joining:
  o New NetApi library for domain join related queries (libnetapi.so)
    and example GTK+ Domain join gui.
  o New client and server support for remotely joining and unjoining
    Domains.
  o Support for joining into Windows 2008 domains.

  Users & Groups:
  o New ldb backend for local group mapping tables
  o Raised level of security defaults for authentication operations.


  Documentation:
  o Inclusion of an HTML version of the 3rd edition of "Using Samba"
    from O'Reilly Publishing.


Now Licensed under the GNU GPLv3
================================

The Samba Team has adopted the Version 3 of the GNU General Public
License for the 3.2 and later releases.   The GPLv3 is the updated
version of the GPLv2 license under which Samba is currently
distributed. It has been updated to improve compatibility with other
licenses and to make it easier to adopt internationally, and is an
improved version of the license to better suit the needs of Free
Software in the 21st Century.

The original announcement is available on-line at

    http://news.samba.org/announcements/samba_gplv3/


New Security Defaults for Authentication
========================================

Support for LanMan passwords is now disabled in both client and server
applications.  Additionally, clear text authentication requests are
disabled by default in client utilities such as smbclient and all
libsmbclient based applications.  This will affect connection both
to and from hosts running DOS, Windows 9x/ME, and OS/2.  Please refer
to the "Changes" section for details on the exact parameters that were
updated.


Registry Configuration Backend
==============================

Samba is now able to use a registry based configuration backed to
supplement smb.conf setting.  This feature may be enabled by setting
"config backend = registry" and "registry shares = yes" in the [global]
section of smb.conf and may be managed using the "net conf" command.

More information may be obtained from the smb.conf(5) and net(8) man
pages.


Removed Features
================

Both the Python bindings and the libmsrpc shared library have been
removed from the tree due to lack of an official maintainer.

As smbfs is no longer supported in current kernel versions, smbmount has
been removed in this Samba version. Please use cifs (mount.cifs) instead.
See examples/scripts/mount/mount.smbfs as an example for a wrapper which
calls mount.cifs instead of smbmount/mount.smbfs.


Modified API for libsmbclient
==============================================================================

Maintaining ABI compatibility for libsmbclient has become increasingly
difficult to accomplish, while also keeping the code organization such that it
is easily readable.  Towards the goal of maintaining ABI compatibility and
also keeping the code easy to maintain and enhance, the API has been enhanced.
In particular, the fields in the SMBCCTX context structure are no longer
intended to be read/write by the user, and are marked as deprecated.  An
application that previously accessed the members of the SMBCCTX context
structure will now encounter warnings if recompiled.  This is intentional, to
encourage implementation of the small changes required for the new interface.
The number of changes is expected to be quite small for the vast majority of
applications, and no changes need be made for many applications.  The changes
required for KDE (konqueror) to conform to the new interface, for example, are
only four lines in only one file.

Instead of the application manually changing or reading values in the context
structure, there are now setter and getter functions for each configurable
member in that structure.  Similarly, the smbc_option_get() and
smbc_option_set() functions are deprecated in favor of the setter/getter
interface.  The setters and getters are all documented in libsmbclient.h
under these comment blocks:

  Getters and setters for CONFIGURATION
  Getters and setters for OPTIONS
  Getters and setters for FUNCTIONS
  Callable functions for files
  Callable functions for directories
  Callable functions applicable to both files and directories

Example changes that may be required to eliminate "deprecated" warnings:

  /* Set the debug level */
  context->debug = 99;
changes to:
  smbc_setDebug(context, 99);

  /* Specify the authentication callback function */
  context->callbacks.auth_fn = auth_smbc_get_data;
changes to:
  smbc_setFunctionAuthData(context, auth_smbc_get_data);

  /* Specify the new-style authentication callback with context parameter */
  smbc_option_set("auth_function", auth_smbc_get_data_with_ctx);
changes to:
  smbc_setFunctionAuthDataWithContext(context, auth_smbc_get_data_with_ctx);

  /* Set kerberos flags */
  context->flags = (SMB_CTX_FLAG_USE_KERBEROS |
                    SMB_CTX_FLAG_FALLBACK_AFTER_KERBEROS);
changes to:
  smbc_setOptionUseKerberos(context, 1);
  smbc_setOptionFallbackAfterKerberos(context, 1);
